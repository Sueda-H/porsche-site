                        Porsche is planning to set up its own fast-charging stations along Europe’s most important
                        routes,
                        with a premium charging experience one expects of the brand. As a pilot site, the first Porsche
                        Charging Lounge is opening today outside Bingen am Rhein. Just two minutes from motorway
                        junction
                        A60/A61, it offers six 300-kW DC fast-charging stations and four 22-kW AC charging points.
                        Further
                        Porsche Charging Lounges are currently planned for Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

                        26/07/2023
                        Porsche is planning to set up its own fast-charging stations along Europe’s most important
                        routes,
                        with a premium charging experience one expects of the brand. As a pilot site, the first Porsche
                        Charging Lounge is opening today outside Bingen am Rhein. Just two minutes from motorway
                        junction
                        A60/A61, it offers six 300-kW DC fast-charging stations and four 22-kW AC charging points.
                        Further
                        Porsche Charging Lounges are currently planned for Germany, Austria and Switzerland.<br>

<br>
                        Located close to busy routes with significant traffic flow, open 24/7, with very high charging
                        performance, a comfortable ambience, and convenient, central billing of charging costs, the new
                        Porsche Charging Lounges are perfectly tailored to the requirements of Porsche drivers on long
                        journeys. Here, all electric and plug-in hybrid models from Porsche can be supplied with
                        electricity
                        at powerful chargers manufactured by South Tyrolean electronic specialist Alpitronic. The
                        fast-charging stations currently provide a maximum of 300 kW but are capable of being upgraded
                        to
                        deliver even higher charging speeds. By the start of next year, 400 kW per charging point should
                        be
                        possible. The charging processes use power from certified renewable sources.

                        “Porsche has mapped out an ambitious path towards electrification. 2030 we want over 80 per cent
                        of
                        the cars that we deliver to be all-electric. This ambitious ramp-up requires a high-performance
                        and
                        dense fast-charging network,” says Oliver Blume, Chairman of the Executive Board of Porsche AG.
                        “The
                        exclusive Porsche Charging Lounges are making an important contribution to this. They are a
                        barrier-free, sustainable and state-of-the-art addition to the IONITY network.”

                    <h2>Unique design</h2>
                    <p>
                        The unique design of the exclusive fast-charging stations underlines their special character.
                        The
                        pilot site in Bingen provides a preview of how this design could look in the future. A slim roof
                        that appears to float connects the charging points with the building. The lounge is glazed from
                        floor to ceiling, creating a smooth transition between inside and outside. Bright colours and
                        light
                        wood provide an atmosphere that promotes a sense of well-being.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first Porsche Charging Lounge in the world is heated and air-conditioned by a heat pump that
                        operates without fossil fuels. Part of the required electricity is provided by the photovoltaic
                        system of solar cells on the roof. The digital building management optimises power consumption,
                        for
                        example by automatically dimming the lighting when there are no guests.

                        To ensure a pleasant visit, there are modern sanitary facilities in the lounge area, as well as
                        a
                        large selection of soft drinks and snacks. Payments can be made with debit and credit cards as
                        well
                        as Apple Pay or Google Pay. Analogue and digital media and a high-performance WiFi network are
                        also
                        available. Workouts can be done in front of a smart mirror to keep the driver fit for the
                        journey
                        ahead. Interactive Porsche content can also be selected here.

                        The Porsche Charging Lounges are integrated in the Porsche Charging Service and are displayed in
                        the
                        navigation system. Central billing is handled by Porsche. Thanks to the Porsche Charging
                        Service,
                        the charging price of 33 cents per kilowatt hour is just as low as for other fast-charging
                        stations
                        in the Porsche network. A Porsche ID is required to access the charging stations and the lounge
                        area. This ID must be linked to the car. If the number plate is stored in the Porsche ID, the
                        barrier opens for you thanks to automatic number plate recognition. The car’s registration
                        number
                        can be stored conveniently in the MyPorsche app. Alternatively, the customer can use their
                        Porsche
                        Charging Card or a QR code from the MyPorsche app to access both the site and the lounge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “With the Porsche Charging Lounge, we are creating another important touchpoint along the
                        customer
                        journey and showing how convenient charging can be for Porsche customers,” says Alexander
                        Pollich,
                        Chairman of the Executive Board of Porsche Deutschland GmbH. “We look forward to hearing our
                        first
                        feedback from customers on their experiences with this new format.”

                    <h2>About the Porsche Charging Service</h2>
                    <p>The Porsche fast-charging stations are an addition to the comprehensive investments that the
                        sports
                        car manufacturer has made in recent years to drive the transition to battery-electric cars. The
                        Porsche Charging Service enables access to the charging points of a range of providers all over
                        the
                        world. The network currently comprises more than 436,000 charging points in over 20 European
                        countries. This includes almost 25,300 charging points with a charging capacity of over 150 kW
                        DC,
                        And more than 500 fast-charging sites in the IONITY network in Europe. Last year, Porsche
                        participated in a further round of financing for this joint venture.<br>
                        <br>
                        More than 600 Porsche dealerships have made a significant contribution to expanding the
                        worldwide
                        charging infrastructure network, with more than 1,000 high-performance charging points for
                        customers
                        being put into operation so far. China has an exclusive network with almost 300 charging points.
                        In
                        co-operation with various partners, more than 400 of these charging points have also been
                        implemented in, for example, Spain, Italy, Korea, Japan and Brazil. In North America, Porsche
                        uses
                        the network of the Volkswagen Group of America. Electrify America currently offers more than
                        3,500
                        fast-charging points at more than 800 stations.</p>
                    <img src="pics/news/charging3.jpeg" alt="Charging Image 2" class="img-fluid mb-4">
                    <p>Porsche is also further expanding the infrastructure for AC charging – with Porsche Destination
                        Charging. There are already more than 5,000 charging points in 86 countries, at luxury
                        destinations
                        particularly popular with Porsche customers. By the end of 2025, this number is expected to
                        exceed
                        7,500. Chargers providing 22 kW instead of 11 kW are already being used at new locations in
                        Europe.
                        Existing stations will be gradually upgraded.</p>
