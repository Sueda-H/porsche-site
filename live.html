                    <p>The birth of the Porsche brand was exactly 75 years ago. On 8 June 1948, the Porsche 356 ‘No. 1’
                        received its general operating permit. For Ferry Porsche, this was a dream come true. The dream
                        of a sports car that had never existed before. This is the entrepreneurial spirit that has
                        characterised the sports car manufacturer to this day. For 75 years, Porsche has been ‘Driven by
                        Dreams’.
                    </p>
                    <img src="pics/news/live1.jpeg" alt="" class=" img-fluid mb-4">
                    <p>Yesterday, the sports car manufacturer celebrated its exemplary success story in five acts
                        together with trailblazers and co-travellers from the past decades. Oliver Blume, host and
                        Chairman of the Executive Board of Porsche AG, opened a spectacular live show at 10.00 pm (CET)
                        at Porscheplatz in Zuffenhausen, in the very heart of the brand. “Pioneering spirit and passion
                        – this is what Porsche is all about. We combine tradition and innovation. We’re always looking
                        forward with courage – but we never forget who we are and where we come from. For 75 years we
                        have been continuously reinventing ourselves. While remaining true to ourselves and our values.
                        Only by constantly changing has Porsche remained Porsche,” Blume concluded.

                    <p>At the end of his speech he announced Dr Wolfgang Porsche, who has been Chairman of the
                        Supervisory Board for many years. Dr Porsche was driven to the stage in the sports car with
                        which the foundation stone of the Porsche legend was laid. Former racing driver Mark Webber
                        piloted the 356 ‘No. 1’ Roadster with the founding family member who has long exemplified the
                        brand.
                        <br><br>“Porsche makes dreams come true. Again and again we have succeeded in surprising and
                        inspiring our customers. With fascinating design. With trailblazing technology. With impressive
                        quality. For 75 years,” said Dr Wolfgang Porsche in front of 800 invited guests during the first
                        act: ‘Heritage’.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Witnesses, brand ambassadors and Porsche representatives from 75 years of brand history</h2>
                    <p>In the following four acts, contemporary witnesses, brand ambassadors and Porsche representatives
                        from 75 years of brand history applied themselves to the topics ‘Zeitgeist’, ‘Performance’,
                        ‘Pioneering Spirit’ and ‘Dreams’. Between speeches from Oliver Blume, Dr Wolfgang Porsche, Head
                        of Design Michael Mauer, Dr Frank-Steffen Walliser, Head of Overall Vehicle Architecture, and
                        brand ambassador Timo Bernhard, the audience enjoyed spectacular stage shows composed of music,
                        light and choreography. The show was accompanied by driving action in the sports cars related to
                        the respective act. Over and over, the evening illustrated the major role that dreams have
                        played at Porsche. Dreams that came true thanks to brave and passionate pioneers. Dreams that
                        have been anchored in the Porsche DNA for 75 years. Dreams that were the origin of unforgettable
                        moments.

                    <h2>Porsche Mission X: yet another dream takes place</h2>
                    <p>At Porsche, innovative concept cars have always laid the groundwork for the future. The sports
                        car manufacturer is continuing this tradition with this latest concept study. Mission X is a
                        spectacular reinterpretation of a hypercar, with Le Mans-style doors that open upwards to the
                        front and a high-performance, efficient electric powertrain. dramatic-looking two-seater
                        celebrated its premiere on 8 June 2023 – the eve of the ‘75 Years of Porsche Sports Cars’
                        exhibition opening at the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen.

                    <p>
                        “The Porsche Mission X is a technology beacon for the sports car of the future. It picks up the
                        torch of iconic sports cars of decades past: like the 959, the Carrera GT and the 918 Spyder
                        before it, the Mission X provides critical impetus for the evolutionary development of future
                        vehicle concepts,” says Oliver Blume, Chairman of the Executive Board of Porsche AG. “Daring to
                        dream and dream cars are two sides of the same coin for us: Porsche has only remained Porsche by
                        constantly changing.” Michael Mauer, Head of Style Porsche, says: “The Mission X is a clear
                        commitment to the core of the brand. The continuing, enhanced expression of our brand and
                        product identity is an important compass for us to navigate the development of our
                        series-production models. The concept study symbolises a symbiosis of unmistakable motorsport
                        DNA with a luxurious overall impression.” Detailed information about the Mission X can be found

                    <h2>Porsche donates € 1,800,000 to ‘Make-A-Wish’</h2>
                    <p>
                        For 75 years, Porsche has been making the dreams of sports car enthusiasts all over the world
                        come true. The sports car manufacturer has also adhered to its social responsibility – even
                        beyond the factory gates. For instance, Porsche has been working together with the non-profit
                        organisation ‘Make-A-Wish’ and international Porsche companies to make the dreams and wishes of
                        seriously ill children and youths all over the world come true.
                        <br><br>To mark its anniversary, the company is donating € 1,800,000 to make 356 wishes come
                        true over the next three years, in a reference to the first Porsche 356. The fulfilment of a
                        wish close to their hearts, and the exciting journey this involves, can give children and their
                        families a positive feeling of hope in a difficult time. The first 75 wishes are to be fulfilled
                        in 2023. The sports car manufacturer plans to share the stories behind the wishes and their
                        fulfilment with the public. ‘Make-A-Wish’ is an organisation operating worldwide since 1980 that
                        has fulfilled the wishes of more than 500,000 children in over 50 countries.

                    <h2>Special exhibition opens up a cosmos full of dreams</h2>
                    <p>As part of the anniversary show, the special exhibition ‘Driven by Dreams. 75 Years of Porsche
                        Sports Cars’ was also ceremoniously opened in the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. On a
                        journey through the Porsche cosmos, visitors experience up close the evolution of the brand over
                        75 years of sports car history. Until 7 January 2024, guests can enjoy exciting stories about
                        the pioneering spirit, feats of engineering, and courage. Between the prologue and the epilogue,
                        the special exhibition covers many topics of the present and the future. The focus is on those
                        people who stand behind the brand. People who, like Ferry Porsche, believed in their dreams, in
                        achieving great things, and in implementing big ideas. Because many dreams originate in the
                        night and are endless like the cosmos itself, the Porsche Museum presents the protagonists of
                        the special exhibition in the night sky.
