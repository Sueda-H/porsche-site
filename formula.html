                        Porsche extends its successful involvement in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship and will

                        Porsche extends its Formula E commitment
                        24/07/2023
                        Porsche extends its successful involvement in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship and will
                        compete in the innovative electric racing series up to and including the 2025/2026 season.
                        When Porsche entered Formula E in 2019, its involvement in the world’s first electric racing
                        series was initially envisaged to run for five years until the 2023/2024 season. In the lead up
                        to the London E-Prix (July 29/30), the Stuttgart-based sports car manufacturer has made an early
                        call to extend its commitment by two years until the end of the 2025/2026 season. Until then,
                        the latest third-generation race cars (Gen3) such as the Porsche 99X Electric will be fielded in
                        the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. In addition, Porsche will be actively involved in the
                        design of the subsequent fourth-generation vehicle, which will be fielded from season 13
                        (2026/2027).<br>
                        <br>
                        “With our entry into Formula E, we have opened a new chapter in all-electric motorsport,” says
                        Michael Steiner, Member of the Executive Board for Research and Development at Porsche AG.
                        “We’re convinced that our presence and successes in Formula E will continue to lay a foundation
                        for future mobility solutions. It offers the most competitive environment to accelerate the
                        development of high-performance vehicles with a focus on environmental friendliness and energy
                        efficiency. We look forward to actively shaping the successful future of Formula E and thereby
                        giving electric mobility even more momentum on a global scale.”

                        “We want to showcase innovative technologies and more sustainability in motor racing and be on
                        the leading edge of new developments,” says Thomas Laudenbach, Vice President of Porsche
                        Motorsport. “Formula E plays a major role in this. The competition in this series is
                        exceptionally high and enables us to provide important impetus for future production models.
                        With such top-level and enthralling races, it excites people around the globe about electric
                        mobility. We’re pleased to contribute to this in the future as well. We want to help shape
                        Formula E in the long term.”

                    <p>
                        Alejandro Agag, Founder and Chairman, Formula E, said: “Porsche has been a valued and
                        influential team since joining Formula E and we are excited that this will continue. The
                        championship is enabling Porsche to accelerate development of the innovative EV technologies we
                        see in their road cars, while the team is an active member of the group, driving the development
                        of the next generation of Formula E cars to arrive in season 13.”<br>
                        <br>

                        Jeff Dodds, CEO, Formula E, said: “Porsche’s commitment to racing in the ABB FIA Formula E World
                        Championship will undoubtedly maintain the quality of sporting competition and entertainment at
                        the highest level in the coming seasons. Porsche’s presence on the grid battling against other
                        iconic racing automakers is what makes Formula E the most competitive grid in motorsport.”

                    <h2>Porsche in Formula E</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2023, the TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team contests its fourth season in the world’s first
                        all-electric racing series with the new Porsche 99X Electric. Thanks to four victories to date
                        achieved by Pascal Wehrlein (GER/3) and António Félix da Costa (POR/1), this season is the most
                        successful since the sports car manufacturer entered the all-electric racing series in 2019. At
                        the season finale in London, the TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E team has a good chance of winning
                        the world championship title as the current runner-up in the teams’ standings. This season,
                        Porsche also supports a customer team for the first time since joining Formula E: Avalanche
                        Andretti and its brilliant driver Jake Dennis have already notched up two victories with the
                        Porsche 99X Electric. As the clear leader of the drivers’ standings, the Englishman heads to the
                        season finale as the hot favourite for the title.<br>
                        <br>

                        Moreover, with the all-electric Taycan Turbo S, Porsche supplies the official safety car, thus
                        underlining the importance of Formula E for Porsche Motorsport.
