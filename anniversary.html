                        The new Porsche 911 S/T: purist special-edition model marks 60th anniversary of the 911
                        02/08/2023
                        Porsche is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the 911 with a special edition built for maximum
                        driving enjoyment: in a limited run of 1,963 examples, the Porsche 911 S/T offers lightweight
                        design and a purist driving experience. For the first time, the high-revving engine from the 911
                        GT3 RS delivers its power to the road via a manual gearbox and lightweight clutch.
                        To mark the special anniversary of the iconic 911 sports car, the engineers in Weissach have
                        designed a highly purist sports car dedicated to sheer driving enjoyment: the 911 S/T. The
                        exclusive anniversary model unites the strengths of the 911 GT3 with Touring Package and the 911
                        GT3 RS and delivers a unique combination of agility and driving dynamics. It combines the
                        naturally aspirated, 386 kW (525 PS, 911 GT3 RS: Fuel consumption* combined (WLTP) 13.4 l/100
                        km, COâ‚‚ emissions* combined (WLTP) 305 g/km) 4.0-litre boxer engine from the 911 GT3 RS with a
                        short-ratio manual transmission. This is complemented by a resolutely lightweight construction
                        and a running-gear setup optimised for agility and drivability. The 911 S/T weighs just 1,380
                        kilograms (DIN kerb weight, incl. all fluids), making it the lightest model of the 992
                        generation. The optional Heritage Design Package draws inspiration from the racing version of
                        the 911 S from the late 1960s and early 1970s.<br><br>
                        The design of the anniversary model incorporated GT and motorsport expertise from Porsche. This
                        is reflected in its particularly nimble and agile handling, which is designed for maximum
                        driving enjoyment on winding country roads. The reduction of rotating mass both in the engine as
                        well as the wheels and brakes ensures particularly dynamic responsiveness. The S/T responds to
                        driver commands instantaneously. Every steering movement, every ounce of pressure on the
                        accelerator or brake is implemented immediately and with pinpoint precision. Unlike the 911 GT3
                        RS, the focus of the development of the 911 S/T has been not on track use, but rather for
                        journeys on public roads.
                    </p>
                    <img src="pics/news/anniversary2.jpeg" alt="Porsche 911 S/T and Porsche 911 S/T with Heritage Design Package
                    " class="img-fluid mb-4">
                    <p>
                        The name marks out the new 911 S/T as the descendant of a particularly performance-focused
                        version of the first 911 generation. From 1969, Porsche offered a special race version of the
                        911 S. Internally, these vehicles were called 911 ST. Modifications to the chassis, wheels,
                        engine and body significantly improved acceleration, braking, traction and cornering grip. Large
                        spoilers and other aerodynamic aids were not yet used in these models. The new 911 S/T takes up
                        the spirit of the original 911 S (ST) and transfers it to the current model generation of the
                        Porsche 911. The anniversary model combines elements of the 911 GT3 RS with the body of the 911
                        GT3 with Touring Package and supplements it with lightweight components specially developed for
                        the 911 S/T. The result is a unique driving experience within the 911 GT portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Lightweight construction from the wings to the clutch</h2>
                    <p>
                        Among other measures, the 911 S/T achieves its particularly agile and direct handling through
                        consistent lightweight design. The front bonnet, roof, front wings and the doors with their
                        striking inlets are made of lightweight carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The same applies
                        to the roll cage, rear axle anti-roll bar and shear panel (stiffening element on the rear axle).
                        Porsche also fits the anniversary model with magnesium wheels, the PCCB system, a lithium-ion
                        starter battery and lightweight glass, all as standard. With reduced insulation, the omission of
                        rear-axle steering and weight savings in the powertrain, the 911 S/T achieves a DIN kerb weight
                        of just 1,380 kg. This makes the car, optimised for a fast-road setup, a further 40 kg lighter
                        than a manual 911 GT3 Touring.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Porsche engineers developed a new lightweight clutch exclusively for the 911 S/T. In conjunction
                        with a single-mass flywheel, it reduces the weight of the rotating mass by 10.5 kg. This
                        noticeably improves the responsiveness of the naturally aspirated boxer engine, which now builds
                        revs with especially bracing speed and directness. Coupled with a six-speed manual transmission
                        with a shorter gear ratio than on the 911 GT3, the high-revving engine in the 911 S/T delivers
                        even more immediacy in its dynamics. It propels the 911 S/T to 100 km/h in just 3.7 seconds. It
                        achieves a top speed of 300 km/h. The exhilarating driving experience is heightened by the
                        compelling soundscape of the standard lightweight sports exhaust system. The 911 S/T is the only
                        911 of the current generation to combine a double-wishbone front-axle design with a multi-link
                        rear axle without rear-axle steering. The dampers and control systems were tuned accordingly.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The aerodynamics of the 911 S/T are also optimised for the public road rather than the racing
                        track. The anniversary model is equipped as standard with a Gurney flap on the extending rear
                        spoiler. Standard equipment also includes 20-inch (front) and 21-inch (rear) lightweight
                        centre-locking magnesium wheels. Ultra-high-performance 255/35 ZR 20 tyres, meanwhile, ensure a
                        high level of mechanical grip at the front of the car. On the rear, the 911 S/T features 315/30
                        ZR 21 tyres. CFRP full bucket seats come as standard. The four-way-adjustable Sports Seat Plus
                        is available at no extra charge. The instrument cluster and the clock of the Sport Chrono
                        package are finished in a classic green Porsche colour scheme.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The 911 S/T is offered with an optional exclusive Heritage Design Package. The new exterior
                        colour Shoreblue Metallic and the wheel rim colour Ceramica are exclusively available for this
                        particularly elegant variant. On the doors, a starting number from 0 to 99 as well as a
                        decorative foil can be applied on request. The classic-design Porsche crest from the original
                        911 that adorns the front, the hub caps, the steering wheel, the headrests and the car key
                        underscores the historic roots of the 911 S/T. The interior also features cloth seat centers in
                        Classic Cognac with black pinstripes, which are another homage to heritage. Two-tone
                        semi-aniline leather trim in Black/Classic Cognac leather with extensive leather surrounds, a
                        roof lining in perforated Dinamica, and other elements from Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur round
                        out the package. The Porsche logo and the 911 S/T model designation on the rear of the car are
                        in Gold.

                        Featuring a titanium case, uncoated and blasted for weight-saving reasons, this exclusive
                        timepiece goes all in on the lightweight design principle of the new purist 911 special edition.
