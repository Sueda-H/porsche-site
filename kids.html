                        Tom Targa and Tina Turbo will help children discover the Porsche Museum’s permanent exhibition
                        via 12 interactive stages, where five- to 13-year-olds can take part in activities, search for
                        quiz answers, solve puzzles, experiment, play and learn. They can then jot down the correct
                        answers in their activity book.

                    <p>
                        To celebrate the brand’s 75th anniversary in 2023, the Porsche Museum is not only inviting
                        adults to take a trip through its history, but also offering two new tours for children, each
                        with six activity stages, which are now part of the permanent exhibition. They can choose
                        between two exciting stories told on the Porsche 4Kids explorer tours. Test driver Tom Targa is
                        getting ready for a big race and wants to build a sports car for it. Meanwhile, development
                        engineer Tina Turbo is looking for creative ideas to take to a competition. On both tours, there
                        are search tasks to complete, puzzles to solve, experiments to try, and lots of fun to be had –
                        all while learning. “Children are much more uninhibited than adults in the way they discover the
                        world,” says Jenny Simchen, who is responsible for the Porsche 4Kids activities at the Porsche
                        Museum. “We want to encourage them to get involved and introduce them to the world of Porsche
                        with Tom Targa and Tina Turbo.”
                    </p>
                    <h2>Activity stages for interaction, playing and learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        The explorer tour with Tom Targa starts with a race. To help him, the children must head to a
                        digital racing track at the Motorsport stage and play a jump-and-run game where they have to
                        collect all the objects that a successful racing driver needs – but avoid all the other
                        unnecessary objects, such as smartphones or footballs. A good racing driver needs
                        lightning-quick reactions.<br>
                        <br>The kids can find out how fast their reactions are at the Race Team stage on a multifunction
                        steering wheel with illuminated buttons. At the Speed stage, the next adventure is a racing
                        speedometer game. With more than 30,000 victories, Porsche has been successful in many different
                        motorsport series. At the Successes stage, the children have the opportunity to go round the
                        Weissach test track as quickly and precisely as possible with the buzz wire game. For a car to
                        go fast, it needs to have as little drag as possible. At the Racing Car stage, the kids can find
                        out whether a Porsche 917 or a Porsche 959 Paris-Dakar creates more turbulence in the wind
                        tunnel. The last stage gives an insight into the naming of Porsche vehicles and how model names
                        such as Taycan or Cayman came about.

                    <p>
                        With a focus on materials of the future, Tina Turbo’s explorer tour teaches the kids what
                        individual vehicle parts are made from at Porsche, with a search for items including fishing
                        nets and quartz sand. The Think Tank stage features a picture of the development centre in
                        Weissach, where there are lots of very well-hidden things to find, including Tina Turbo herself.
                        The tour introduces children to the Weissach facility, what jobs people do there and how a
                        Porsche is made. Another active experience on this tour is the updated Porsche crest, which is
                        in pieces, awaiting skilled puzzlers to put it together. There’s a digital drawing at the Design
                        stage, and the Lightweight Construction stage has a hands-on puzzle, which teaches the children
                        how Porsche reduces the weight of its racing cars. With the Pioneering Spirit quiz, the children
                        can delve into the early days of the sports car manufacturer.

                    <p>
                        After buying a ticket and choosing a tour, every child can buy a Porsche 4Kids discovery book in
                        German and English, which will guide them through the museum. The book’s carry handle makes it
                        easy for the children to carry it around. The kids then simply jot the correct answers in their
                        books. They can also listen to tips from the Porsche 4Kids Multimedia Guide, in which Tom Targa
                        and Tina Turbo tell many more exciting Porsche stories. Once they have completed all the tasks
                        and solved all the puzzles, the discovery book has either a Porsche racing car or a trophy ready
                        to cut out, colour in and put up as a souvenir at home. Children will receive the Porsche 4Kids
                        activity book, which is normally available for 5 euros, free of charge during the summer
                        vacations from July 27 to September 10.

                    <h2>Exciting summer holiday programme with hands-on activities and walking tours
                    </h2>
                    <p>For six and a half weeks, Porsche 4Kids promises lots of fun for children, with a varied summer
                        holiday programme. From 27 July to 10 September 2023, children from the age of five can have fun
                        in the Porsche Museum free of charge. Every day at 10:00 CET, Tom Targa takes the kids into the
                        world of motorsport, where they can look inside a racing car and even try on a racing suit.
                    </p>
                    <img src="pics/news/kids4.jpeg" alt="" class=" img-fluid mb-4">
                    <p>At 15:00 CET, Tina Turbo takes them into the world of innovation, where they can handle different
                        materials and hold a real Porsche crest in their hands. Interested parties can register up until
                        the day before the tour via this link and come and learn more about Tom and Tina's world. Any
                        remaining places will then be allocated at the ticket desk on the day of the tour. During the
                        one-hour tour, parents have the opportunity to look at the current 75 Years of Porsche Sports
                        Cars special exhibition.
                        <br><br>Three days a week, between 13:00 CET. and 16:00 CET, there are special hands-on
                        activities for kids: the Dr!ft Driving Challenge on Tuesdays, picture colouring on Wednesdays
                        and a leather workshop on Thursdays. On the weekends of 29-30 July and 12-13 August, Tom Targa
                        and Tina Turbo will also be visiting from 10:00 to 16:00 CET and will walk around the museum
                        every hour on the hour. The Porsche 4Kids photo challenge with three creative photo tasks
                        provides souvenir photos of the museum visit for the whole family. After so much action, it's
                        worth taking a break in the Boxenstopp bistro, where girls and boys can get French fries and
                        sundaes at a discount price during the summer programme. In addition, children receive the
                        Porsche 4Kids activity book free of charge, which they need to playfully discover the activity
                        stages in the permanent exhibition.
